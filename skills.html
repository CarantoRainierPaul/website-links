    <div class="box"> <p> I think I have several skills that actually help me build myself and get to where I want to be. 
Number 1 is the mindset that I have. For me, having the right mindset everyday would help people to get their job done and be successful for whatever they do. I always set my mindset and my mentality right. If you would ask how I got that skill, well I think it’s because of my athletic background. Mindset is really important when you are an athlete because it dictates how you will perform. Kobe Bryant is a big influence in having my skills, Kobe is a big believer that with hard work, you will succeed. So, he studied all the details for him to be the greatest basketball player. Number 2 is the Strong work ethic. Just like Kobe, nobody became great at what they do if they didn’t work hard enough. Staying consistent is the key to all success, and that’s what I always tell myself.</p>
