        <div class="box"> <p>I have many hobbies that keep me engaged and happy. I love watching videos on youtube, tiktok, and other video entertainment platforms. Whenever I don’t have anything to do I would go open my phone and watch videos. I also love playing video games, it is what I really love to do, I couldn't finish my day without playing video games, that’s how I love doing it. And since I am also an athlete, working out is also one of my hobbies. I also love doing it because it lets me have a productive day. Learning new things is also one of my hobbies as well, I just love the thought of getting to learn something new everyday and it would actually let me realize the impact of it for my future. I love to experience something new too, like what they would always say, “you only live once”. I do maximize every time that I have to enjoy life as well as securing my future. My hobbies bring me joy, help me grow, and make life more enjoyable.
